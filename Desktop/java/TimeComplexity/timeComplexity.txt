Time complexity != Time taken

O(1) < O(logn) < O(n)
Always look for worst case complexity.
Always look at complexity for large data.


Space complexity:-
 Input space and auxiliary space:- The space which we are taking as input and the space used by the algorithm.


Recursive Algorithms :-
---------------------
Recursive program don't have the constant  space complexity.
Space complexity of the recursive program is the height of the tree.

Two types of the recursive program :-

(1) Linear            |   (2) Divide and conquer
F(n)= f(n-1)+f(n-2)   |    F(n)= f(n/2)+O(1)
                      |    example: binary search
